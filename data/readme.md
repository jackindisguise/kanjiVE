# Files
## `anki-progressive.tsv`
* Uses data from `anki.json`
* Generated by `anki-progressive.js`

An SRS deck that ultimately matches the **kanjiVE** ordering, but is split up into grades based on the kyouiku kanji.

## `anki.json`
* Uses data from `kanjive.json`, `jouyou.json`, `keywords.json` and `names.json`
* Generated by `anki.js`

This is primarily used for generating `anki-progressive.tsv` to save time.

## `anki.tsv`
* Uses data from `kanjive.json`, `jouyou.json`, `keywords.json`, and `names.json`
* Generated by `anki.js`

An SRS deck with the kanji ordered to match the **kanjiVE** ordering.

## `associations.json`
* Uses data from `associations.txt`
* Generated by `prepare.js`

Element associations defined in `associations.txt` are propagated among all other elements for convenience.

That means this:
```
見\t目,儿
儿\t丿,㇟
```

will produce the following JSON:
```json
[{"element":"見","parts":["目","儿","丿","㇟"]},{"element":"儿","parts":["丿","㇟"]}]
```

As you can see, the elements of `儿` are added to `見`, as `儿` is one of its elements.

## `associations.txt`
* Not generated.

This file provides manual element associations with other elements to the **kanjiVE** algorithm
```
見\t目,儿
儿\t丿,㇟
```
This specifies that `見` is made of `目` and `儿`, and `儿` is made of `丿` and `㇟`.

## `elements.json`
* Uses data from **KanjiVG**
* Generated by `kanjive.js`

## `elements.txt`
* Uses data from **KanjiVG**
* Generated by `kanjive.js`

Details all of the elements that are used and what kanji they are used in.

## `jouyou.json`
* Uses data from `jouyou.txt`
* Generated by `prepare.js`

## `jouyou.txt`
* Not generated.

A list of all 2136 jouyou kanji, including reference to the grade they are learned and the frequency of the kanji according to [this research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357159664_2242_Kanji_Frequency_List_ver_11).

Debating moving to [this corpus](https://scriptin.github.io/kanji-frequency/) for kanji frequency info for accuracy purposes, though I'm not super concerned with it at the moment.

## `kanjive.json`
* Uses data from `kanjivg.json`, `associations.json`, `type.json`, `order.json` and `jouyou.json`
* Generated by `kanjive.js`

## `kanjive.txt`
* Uses data from `kanjivg.json`, `associations.json`, `type.json`, `order.json` and `jouyou.json`
* Generated by `kanjive.js`

## `kanjivg.json`
* Uses data from **KanjiVG**
* Generated by `kanjivg.js`

Technically the primary dataset of the project.

**KanjiVG** is a project that creates vector-based images for kanji. This is an extremely useful tool for learners, as the images are actually drawn using strokes in an order that follows Japanese stroke order rules. Upon further inspection, **KanjiVG** also provides data about the strokes themselves, including a unicode representation of the stroke, and of entire subcharacters that appear in a kanji.

Using joyou kanji as a basis, this file contains all of the elements and subcharacters found in each jouyou kanji.

## `kanjivg.txt`
* Uses data from **KanjiVG**
* Generated by `kanjivg.js`

## `keywords.json`
* Uses data from `keywords.txt`
* Generated by `prepare.js`

## `keywords.txt`
* Not generated.

Essentially a list of all of the RTK 6.0 kanji and their keywords.

## `names.json`
* Uses data from `names.txt`
* Generated by `prepare.js`

## `names.txt`
* Not generated.

A list of names for symbols that appear in the **KanjiVG** data set but don't have keywords associated with them. This is meant to be used in conjunction with the `keywords.json` dataset to present learners with a list of English words to associate with symbols. When you are shown 見, you will see that it's made of 目 (eye) and 儿 (legs radical).

## `order.json`
* Uses data from `order.txt`
* Generated by `prepare.js`

## `order.txt`
* Not generated.

Tells the **kanjiVE** algorithm to introduce a character right after another one. This allows us to artificially introduce characters based on some preference. In my case, I've forced it to introduce the characters for the numbers 1-10 right away.

## `type.json`
* Uses data from `type.txt`
* Generated by `prepare.txt`

## `type.txt`
* Not generated.

Allows us to use **KanjiVG** "type" fields to associate more complex elements that **KanjiVG** deigned not to include in its dataset.

For example, `危` contains the subcharacter `㔾`, but **KanjiVG** does not include it. It does, however, include the type sequence `㇆` >> `㇟/㇑`.

As such, we've defined the type sequence `㇆` >> `㇟/㇑` to add an association with `㔾` in the **kanjiVE** algorithm.

```
㔾\t㇆,㇟/㇑
```
