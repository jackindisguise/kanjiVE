## `anki-progressive.tsv`
* Uses data from `anki.json`
* Generated by `anki-progressive.js`

An SRS deck that ultimately matches the **kanjiVE** ordering, but is split up into grades based on the kyouiku kanji.

## `anki.json`
* Uses data from `kanjive.json`, `jouyou.json`, `keywords.json`, and `names.json`
* Generated by `anki.js`

This matches the `anki.tsv` data and ordering, but is in JSON format.
This is primarily used for generating `anki-progressive.tsv` to save time.

## `anki.tsv`
* Uses data from `kanjive.json`, `jouyou.json`, `keywords.json`, and `names.json`
* Generated by `anki.js`

An SRS deck with the kanji ordered to match the **kanjiVE** ordering.

## `associations.json`
* Uses data from `associations.txt`
* Generated by `prepare.js`

Element associations defined in `associations.txt` are propagated among all other elements for convenience.
That means the above example will generate the following JSON:

```json
[{"element":"見","parts":["目","儿","丿","㇟"]},{"element":"儿","parts":["丿","㇟"]}]
```

As you can see, the elements of `儿` are added to `見`, as `儿` is one of its elements.

## `associations.txt`
* Not generated.

This file provides manual element associations with other elements to the **kanjiVE** algorithm
```
見\t目,儿
儿\t丿,㇟
```
This specifies that `見` is made of `目` and `儿`, and `儿` is made of `丿` and `㇟`.
